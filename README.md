## Quadtree Simulation

Definition: A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. ~ Wikipedia.

This implementation is solely for learning purposes about implementation of quadtree and how it's used for collision detection. The implemented demos are of:
- Quadtree Rect simulation: It can store and retrieve rectangles in a recursive 2D quadtree.
- Quadtree particle collisions: Collides 1000 particles Objects simulatenously.

### Run
- Clone this repo locally on your Desktop.
- Run index.html with live server.

### Further optimization for learing:
- adding action players instead of rectangles.
- adding real-time tree buildout visualization.
