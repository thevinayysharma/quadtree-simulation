## Quadtree Simulation
<hr>

Definition: A quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of octrees and are most often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions.

This implementation is solely for learning purposes about quadtree for collision detection.
- Quadtree Rect simulation: It can store and retrieve rectangles in a recursive 2D quadtree.


### Demo
- [Quadtree simulation]()

### Further optimization for learing:
- adding action players instead of rectangles.
- adding real-time tree buildout visualization.
